                        <h1>Therapies</h1>
                        <p>Kinesiology was originally developed by an American chiropractor called George Goodheart. He found that by testing muscle response before and after he made chiropractic corrections he achieved better results for his patients. As time progressed he was able to make a connection between various muscles and acupuncture meridians. By testing these muscles the kinesiologist can get a picture of what is happening in your meridian system and how this may be affecting you.
                            So, kinesiology can be seen as a blend of the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine and western techniques which enable a kinesiologist to treat you as an individual.  Each personâ€™s session is unique to them.     
                            Kinesiology uses a range of gentle yet extremely powerful techniques. Kinesiology also allows the kinesiologist to draw on other healing techniques and modalities and integrate them into the session where appropriate and indicated by the muscle response.</p>
